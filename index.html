  <img src="fire.jpg" alt="fire image"> It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
  Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
  spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
  in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her
  four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the
  cave where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf. "It is time to
  hunt again." He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
  a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O
  Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
  children that they may never forget the hungry in this world."
</p>
<p>
  It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India
  despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling
  tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
  rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more
  than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
  that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
  everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui
  goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
  a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the
  madness--and run.

  "Enter, then, and look," said Father Wolf stiffly, "but there is no food
  here."
